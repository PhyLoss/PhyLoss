# Count gene gain/lost for a focal species (given taxID, e.g. 9606 H. sap.) and annotate clusters and the genes in each cluster with COG/GO functions using emapper results
# # Rules for computing gene families' gain/loss  (Dollo's parsimony applied):
# 	if a cluster contains genes of the focal species
# 	(1a) if a cluster contains only members (genes) of the focal species, then I'll suppose that they originated at its minPS (== maxPS) (PS --> phylostratum), 
# 	(2) if a cluster also contains other species' genes, then the gene family was gained in minPS and still exists (not lost) 
#	
# 	(1b) if a cluster contains only members (genes) of one (non-focal) species,
