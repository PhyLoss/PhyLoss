# Count gene gain/lost for a focal species (given taxID, e.g. 9606 H. sap. and the number of its phylostrata: 39)
# Rules:
	# if (foundT) { # a cluster contains genes of the focal species
		# (1a) if a cluster contains only members (genes) of the focal species, then I'll suppose that they originated at its minPS (== maxPS), and are not lost (clusterRepresentative is from the focal species)
		# (2) if a cluster also contains other species' genes, then the gene family was gained in minPS and still exists (not lost) (clusterRepresentative doesn't have to be from the focal species)
	
	# (1b) if a cluster contains only members (genes) of one (non-focal) species, 
	# then I'll suppose that they originated at the species PS (or its lineage) --> CAN BE IGNORED FROM THE POINT OF FOCAL SPECIES
	
	# (3) multiple species, and belonging to different PS; from t's point of view: gene family gained at minPS, gene family lost at (maxPS+1)

	# (4) multiple species, and belonging to the same PS --> CAN BE IGNORED FROM THE POINT OF FOCAL SPECIES
		# (4a) if LCA of these species equals the cluster's minPS (== maxPS), than from t's point of view: gene family gained at minPS, gene family lost at (maxPS+1)
		# (4b) if LCA of these species does not equal the cluster's minPS (== maxPS), than UNRESOLVED (i.e. for example their LCA with the focal species is "Cell. organisms", but their LCA is "Viridiplantae")
	
	# In conclusion:
	# Only cases (foundT) (i.e. 1a and 2) and (3) are USED FOR COMPUTING GENE FAMILIES GAINED/LOST FROM THE FOCAL SPECIES PERSPECTIVE
