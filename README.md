### PhyLoss - phylostratigraphy of gene families gain and loss
The repository contains the data and the analysis scripts accompanying the manuscript Domazet-Lošo M., Široki T., Šimičević K., Domazet-Lošo T. 2023, **Macroevolutionary dynamics of gene family gain and loss along multicellular eukaryotic lineages**.

## Requirements
To run the scripts you need to install Python 3.6 or later, and MMseqs2
