### PhyLoss - phylostratigraphy of gene families gain and loss
The repository contains the sample data and the analysis scripts accompanying the manuscript 
Domazet-Lošo, M., Široki, T., Šimičević, K. and Domazet-Lošo T. **Macroevolutionary dynamics of gene family gain and loss along multicellular eukaryotic lineages**. Nat Commun 15, 2663 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47017-w
